## What is Gerber Accumark?
 
Gerber Accumark is a software solution that transforms your design, development and marker-making process through an industry-leading suite of software applications[^4^]. It allows you to visualize your designs, create accurate patterns and optimize your markers while seamlessly sharing data throughout the supply chain.
 
Gerber Accumark consists of three main modules:
 
- **Gerber Accumark 2D**: This is the world's leading fashion design software for pattern design, grading and marker making[^5^]. It offers several grading options, automated processes and industry-leading image functionality. It helps you maximize efficiency, increase throughput and enhance communication while quickly bringing your ideas to life.
- **Gerber Accumark 3D**: This is a design module that lets you visualize your patterns in 3D with the click of a button[^4^]. It enables you to unleash your creative vision, speed up your design process and promote global collaboration. It also helps you improve fit and reduce the number of physical samples by creating production-ready virtual samples[^5^].
- **Gerber AccuNest**: This is an automated nesting application that saves you time and money by automatically generating cost and production markers[^4^]. It uses powerful algorithms to analyze multiple nesting solutions and identify the option with the highest material utilization. It dramatically accelerates the nesting process and reduces costs[^6^].

## What are the benefits of Gerber Accumark?
 
Gerber Accumark offers many benefits for fashion and apparel professionals, such as:

- **Accelerated time to market**: Gerber Accumark helps you cut your development time by two weeks by saving steps and reducing errors using smart pattern making tools[^4^]. You can also easily communicate design details and information outside of Gerber Accumark using new integration tools with YuniquePLMâ¢[^4^].
- **Improved fit and quality**: Gerber Accumark helps you reduce your physical samples by up to 50% by visualizing samples in 3D[^4^]. You can instantly change patterns and adjust image locations to ensure the best fit and quality for your products.
- **Maximized material utilization**: Gerber Accumark helps you increase your throughput by up to 50% by creating efficient spread and cut plans that fit your needs[^4^]. With Gerber AccuNest, you can make the most of your existing marker library to optimize your workflow, while saving on labor and material costs[^4^].
- **Enhanced collaboration**: Gerber Accumark helps you work better with your team members, suppliers and customers by seamlessly sharing data throughout the supply chain[^4^]. You can also work faster with global partners by using Gerber AccuMark 3D to visualize designs in real time[^5^].
- **Increased flexibility**: Gerber Accumark offers a range of optional modules that can suit your specific needs, such as:
    - **Gerber AccuMark Made-to-Measure**: This module offers advanced automation functionality for tailors and manufacturers of custom clothing. It allows you to easily generate patterns with measurements from any source and automatically create markers[^4^].
    - **Gerber AccuPlan**: This module streamlines the CAD-to-cut-room process by generating sophisticated spread and cut plans based on fabric rolls and cutting table availability. It also helps you plan multiple cut work orders together with a powerful production tracker[^4^].
    - **Gerber AccuScan**: This module uses a high 0f148eb4a0
