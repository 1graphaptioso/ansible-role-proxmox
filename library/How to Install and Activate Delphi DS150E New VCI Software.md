## Step 1: Download Delphi DS150E New VCI Software
 
You can download the software from various online sources, such as OBD2Tuning[^1^], MHH Auto[^2^] or hex2stuff[^3^]. Make sure you choose the correct version that matches your hardware and operating system. The software usually comes with a keygen or an activation file that you will need later.
 
## Step 2: Run the Software Setup
 
After downloading the software, copy it to your computer and run the setup.exe file. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the software. You may need to turn off your internet connection and antivirus software before installation. You may also need to delete any old versions of the software if you have them.
 
## Step 3: Generate the Activation File
 
After installing the software, you need to generate an activation file to activate it. There are two ways to do this:
 
- The first way is to use the keygen that comes with the software. Run the keygen.exe file and enter your hardware ID (you can find it in the software). Then click generate and save the file activation.xml to your desktop.
- The second way is to send your hardware ID to your supplier or someone who can activate it for you. They will send you back an activated file activation.xml that you need to save to your desktop.

## Step 4: Import the Activation File
 
After getting the activation file, you need to import it to the software to activate it. Run the main.exe file in the software folder and click start. Then click no and browse to the file activation.xml on your desktop. Wait for the activation process to complete, then you can enjoy using your Delphi DS150E New VCI software.
 
## Troubleshooting
 
If you encounter any errors or problems during the installation or activation process, here are some possible solutions:

- If you can't run the keygen, you may need to install net-framework 4.0 from Google.
- If you get an error message saying "Operation Failed, Please check that installed version is valid for your type of VCI", you may have installed a wrong version of the software or have a faulty hardware.
- If you can't connect to your vehicle or have communication issues, you may need to check your drivers, cables, settings and protocols.
